# Data-Collection

This program will capture data every 15 seconds and print the most recent 5 captures to the screen when clicking the data capture button. 
The way it is set initially is to collect measurements in either inches or centimeters from a virtual device I have created.
This device can be replaced or configured to intercept data from any source, and I will be adding components to the program
to make this much easier soon.
